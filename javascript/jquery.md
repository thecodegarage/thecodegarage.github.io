# JQuery Reference

https://jquery.com/

JQuery is a framework implemented on top of JavaScript.

size of JQuery today: 32kB minified

Features of JQuery:

- HTML/DOM manipulation. traversing and modifying the DOM.
- CSS manipulation.
- HTML event methods. binding methods
- Effects and animations.
- AJAX support.
- Utilities (e.g. feature detection)

created in 2006.

developers raved about its ease of use. One could write less code

cross browser compatibility - it mitigated many legacy browser JS compatibility issues

made Json parsing easy

extensible through plug-ins, n number of free plugins (e.g. JQuery UI, JQuery Mobile)
